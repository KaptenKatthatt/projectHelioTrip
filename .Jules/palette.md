## 2024-05-07 - Add focus indicators to HUD icon buttons
**Learning:** Found that base HUD icon buttons (`HudIconButton` and `HudPanelToggleButton`) lacked keyboard focus styles, making them invisible to keyboard navigators despite having ARIA labels.
**Action:** Always include `focus-visible` styles (`focus:outline-none focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-white/40`) on custom buttons to ensure keyboard accessibility matches mouse hover states.
